Step 1)
Path Planning (EPF, Dubins, Straight line, others?)

Step 2) 
Enter Collision Avoidance or not?
-Decide this based on geometric approach and feed that info to FL engine

	No - Continue on current path (see Step 1)

	Yes - Is collision due to a path intersection or conflict zone intersection?
		
		Path Intersection - FL engine #1
			output = change in heading
				convert heading to point one step into future

		Conflict Zone intersection - FL engine #2
			output = change in heading
				convert heading to point one step into future

Ideas for simulation

Run 4 planes with C.A. on top of 4 planes with same goals without.
Run 4 planes without C.A. in same sim as 4 planes with, to see how reacts with "enemy" planes
